## Configuring

Assuming that you already have your ES6 environment configured with babel (if you dont know how to configure a babel environment, you can download our [NevinhaJS Boirlaplate](http://github.com.br/nevinhajs/boirlaplate) â¬†), you just need to add in your package.json the nevinhajs through the command:

```javascript
yarn add nevinha-js
```
if you don't have yarn, you can use the npm command:

```javascript
npm install nevinha-js
```

We use JSX syntaxe by default, so you'll need to add the `transform-react-jsx` babel plugin to convert the JSX to javascript:
```javascript
yarn add -D babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx
```

After that in your .babelrc file, you have to put the follow lines:

```javascript
"plugins": [
  [
  "transform-react-jsx",
    { "pragma": "NevinhaDOM" }
  ]
]
```
