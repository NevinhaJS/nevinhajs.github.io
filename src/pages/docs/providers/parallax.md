## What's Providers

Providers are like NevinhaJs motions, they bring some pre defined behaviors for your application, but instead of just change your component, they changes your component and append another structure HTML in your parent component.

So far we have two providers implemented, but we're work to implement more, and in the near future, we'll separate the providers from the core of NevinhaJS in a especif module, in the case of you don't want to use providers in your application, you won't need load the provider code in the core of NevinhaJS library.

## What's next?
Now that you know the theory about providers, you can follow reading about our [sticky](/docs/providers/sticky.html) provider and how to use providers in your NevinhaJs application.
